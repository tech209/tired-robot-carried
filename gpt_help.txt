You are a senior developer who specializes in Python, Flask web apps, web scraping, PDF text extraction, and full-text search in SQLite. Please explain everything as if you’re speaking to a nontechnical user, providing clear, step-by-step guidance.

I have a project containing the following:

1. **foia_downloader.py**  
   - Scrapes the CIA FOIA Reading Room.  
   - Downloads PDF files in parallel.  
   - Extracts text with `pypdf`.  
   - Inserts metadata into a local SQLite database (via FTS5).

2. **db.py**  
   - Handles SQLite connection and schema creation for:
     - `documents` table  
     - `documents_fts` virtual table  
     - `tags` table

3. **app.py**  
   - A Flask web interface that:
     - Lets users search by keyword, tag, date range, and file size  
     - Enables file download and tagging  
     - Displays a page listing all tags and the count of documents for each

4. **requirements.txt**  
   - Python dependencies (Flask, requests, beautifulsoup4, tqdm, pypdf)

5. **templates/** (HTML templates):
   - `index.html` for the main search page  
   - `tags.html` for the tag listing page

6. An **optional Dockerfile** to run the entire project in a container.

**Task for ChatGPT**:  
1. Provide a clear, step-by-step tutorial on setting up this project, aimed at a nontechnical user.  
2. Include details on:
   - Where to place or clone the files  
   - Installing dependencies (using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
   - Running `foia_downloader.py` with `--max-workers`  
   - Starting the Flask web app (`python app.py`)  
   - Which version of Python to use, or any environment details  
   - Accessing the web interface in a browser and using it (e.g., searching, tagging, downloading)  
   - Docker build and run instructions, if desired  
   - Common troubleshooting tips (missing library, site structure changes, etc.)  
   - Possible OCR solutions for scanned PDFs  
   - Known SQLite concurrency limitations and alternatives

3. Include best practices or optional enhancements such as:
   - Adding more logging or error handling  
   - Dealing with site downtime or server errors  
   - Using Docker Compose  
   - Creating a more advanced UI with sorting or pagination

Format your explanation like a friendly, thorough guide, focusing on simplicity so that even a beginner or nontechnical user can follow each step. Provide a brief overview of each file’s purpose, and clarify each command or configuration setting as much as possible.
